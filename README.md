# What is Quipper?
Quipper is an embedded, scalable functional programming language for quantum computers. 
# Features:
The Quipper distribution also includes implementations of seven non-trivial quantum algorithms:

    Childs et al.'s Boolean Formula algorithm.
    Childs et al.'s quantum walk algorithm on Binary Welded Trees.
    Hallgren's Class Number algorithm.
    Whitfield et al.'s Ground State Estimation algorithm.
    Harrow et al.'s Quantum Linear Systems algorithm.
    Magniez et al.'s Triangle Finding algorithm.
    Regev and Kuperberg's Unique Shortest Vector algorithm.

I do not own the quipper language or program as I only made the single step installer and auto update files for the quipper program. If you see this please notice me and send a few dollars to my paypal.me/monroe607
