# Quipper
This is a repository dedicated to quipper a quantum computing coding based language.
Please note you will have to unzip the file to view the components of this file
# What is Quipper?
Quipper is an embedded, scalable functional programming language for quantum computers. 
# Features:
The Quipper distribution also includes implementations of seven non-trivial quantum algorithms:

    Childs et al.'s Boolean Formula algorithm.
    Childs et al.'s quantum walk algorithm on Binary Welded Trees.
    Hallgren's Class Number algorithm.
    Whitfield et al.'s Ground State Estimation algorithm.
    Harrow et al.'s Quantum Linear Systems algorithm.
    Magniez et al.'s Triangle Finding algorithm.
    Regev and Kuperberg's Unique Shortest Vector algorithm. 
    
# Install:
unzip Quipper.zip
rm Quiper.zip (Unecessary, but I like to keep things clean)
cd INSTALL
./setup.sh

You'll also notice an update.sh file. This file will remove most of the files then reinstall everything with the latest requirements. MIGHT be moving to be a seperate download for conveniency and efficiency sake.

# Credits: 
I do not own the quipper language or program as I only made the single step installer and auto update files for the quipper program. If you see this please notice me and send a few dollars to my paypal.me/monroe607
